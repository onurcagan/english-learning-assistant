## Work-in-Progress & To-Dos

- [ ]  Add favorites
- [ ]  Make every word on screen be clickable and when clicked show their definition
- [ ]  Fix the vertical scrollbar pushing the page content to the side
  - Options found so far:
    - Have a scrollbar showing up at all times with overflow:scroll, and since on mobile the scrollbar doesn't take up any space I need to account for it using media queries. 
    - Calculating the width of the scrollbar and experimenting with a padding-left or a minus margin-right.
    - ..?
